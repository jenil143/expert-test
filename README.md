# Bug Fixes Documentation – Scheduling App (v1.3.0)
🛠️## Overview
This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the
Scheduling App

## Critical Fixes Implemented
### 1. Timezone Display Errors in Appointments
**File**: `src/utils/dateFormatter.ts`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed
#### Problem
Appointment times displayed inconsistently across users in different timezones. A
booking at 4:00 PM EST appeared as 1:00 PM PST, leading to:
- Missed meetings
- Confusion in customer support
- Frustration and loss of trust
#### Root Cause
Timestamps were rendered using `new Date().toLocaleString()` without setting a
consistent server-side timezone.
#### Fix
Replaced local formatting with a UTC-standardized formatter using `date-fns-tz`:
```typescript
format(utcToZonedTime(appointmentTimeUTC, userTimeZone), 'hh:mm a zzz')
```
✅

#### Impact
-
Accurate appointment display in all user timezones

Fewer missed appointments

Time consistency across platforms

### 2. Duplicate Bookings on Retry
**File**: `src/hooks/useBookAppointment.ts`
**Severity**: High
**Status**:
Fixed
✅#### Problem
Users experiencing network issues and retrying caused **duplicate bookings**, which
cluttered the database and overbooked slots.
#### Root Cause
No idempotency token was implemented to recognize retries of the same booking.
#### Fix
Introduced a unique `x-request-id` in each booking attempt and deduplicated on the
server:
```typescript
// Frontend
axios.post('/api/book', payload, {
headers: { 'x-request-id': uuidv4() }
});
```
```ts
// Backend
if (hasAlreadyProcessed(requestId)) return;
```
